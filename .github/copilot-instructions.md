Avoid using comments;

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): This principle emphasizes avoiding code duplication to reduce maintenance complexity and potential inconsistencies. Continuously review and refactor your code to identify and eliminate repetitions.

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Encourage simplicity in your code and design, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Focus on delivering features that are currently needed, rather than over-engineering or anticipating future requirements that may never materialize.

Composition Over Inheritance: Favor using composition (combining simple objects or components to create more complex ones) over inheritance (creating new classes by inheriting properties and methods from a parent class) for code reuse and flexibility. This can lead to more modular and less coupled designs.

Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge): An object should have limited knowledge about other objects in the system, interacting only with its "close friends". This helps reduce coupling between components.
